| Key Features | (Bentley) Production-Ready Digital Twins | My PaperLot POC |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Single View of the Truth** | Combine disparate engineering data from diverse design tools into a federated environment with no disruption to existing tools or processes. Align engineering data with geospatial, IoT, and operational data. Build and manage small to very large digital twins. | PaperLot already functions as a federated environment through an event-sourcing architecture. All changes are recorded as immutable, append-only events in a single ledger, with a separated projection layer and UI layer built on top. Currently uses a single seeded data source at startup, but is designed to grow by adding new event producers (e.g., YOLO-based computer vision or other IoT sensors) without architectural changes. PaperLot aligns data with reality through time and causality rather than visual realism; each car event is timestamped and replayable, enabling reconstruction of past, present, and simulated future states. |
| **Visualize, Simulate, and Monitor** | Visualize and track changes, including real-world conditions from IoT-connected devices. Combine federated data to reflect current conditions and predict future conditions for inspection, reporting, and insights. Use immersive visualization. Obtain analytics visibility through AI/ML. | PaperLot visualizes and tracks change by folding an immutable event stream into current state, making every change observable and replayable. Currently uses a 2D, SVG-based view, but can extend to WebGL or 3D visualization without changing its architecture. Defines car and lot states today, and can extend to inventory or other asset states. Can leverage AI/ML in the future to predict outcomes based on real historical event data. |
| **Improve Decisions. Get Results.** | Reduce cost and time of delivering projects and managing assets. Improve service quality. Reduce asset risk and liability. Meet sustainability goals. | A production-ready evolution of PaperLot can support real business use cases such as Site Development Planning. It answers questions like how much parking is enough, how future growth changes demand, and what happens when buildings or entrances are added or removed. Unlike traditional SDPs that rely on static assumptions and surveys, PaperLot acts as the behavioral layer—planning from observed behavior, replayable history, and simulated futures. It transforms a Site Development Plan from a static document into a living, replayable Digital Twin that validates design decisions before concrete is poured. |
